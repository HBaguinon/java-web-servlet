* PURPOSE: This program is the third project, but it's numbered as "4" due to  *
*          Project 2 being skipped. This program is a website/servlet that will*
*          provide outputs depending on the user's selection. It can display   *
*          information on sun and moon data for one day, a duration of         *
*          lightness/darkness for one day, dates of primary phases of the moon,*
*          the fraction of the moon illuminated, or the altitude and azimuth of*
*          the sun or moon during the day. This program uses several languages *
*          and techniques, including AJAX, HTML, Java, Javascript, and Beans.  *
*          It is a continuation of Project 3.                                  *
